\title{Calculate the perplexity on new data with a celda_C model}
\usage{
\S4method{perplexity}{celda_C}(counts, celda.mod, new.counts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Integer matrix. Rows represent features and columns represent cells. This matrix should be the same as the one used to generate `celda.mod`.}

\item{celda.mod}{Celda object of class "celda_C"}

\item{new.counts}{A new counts matrix used to calculate perplexity. If NULL, perplexity will be calculated for the 'counts' matrix. Default NULL.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The perplexity for the provided count data and model.
}
\description{
Perplexity is a statistical measure of how well a probability model can predict new data. Lower perplexity indicates a better model.
}
\examples{
perplexity = perplexity(celda.C.sim$counts, celda.C.mod)
}
\seealso{
`celda_C()` for clustering cells
