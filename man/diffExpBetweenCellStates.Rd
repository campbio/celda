\title{Gene expression markers for cell clusters using MAST}
\usage{
diffExpBetweenCellStates(counts, celda.mod, c1, c2 = NULL,
  only.pos = FALSE, log2fc.threshold = NULL, fdr.threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Integer matrix. Rows represent features and columns represent cells. This matrix should be the same as the one used to generate `celda.mod`.}

\item{celda.mod}{Celda model. Options are "celda_C" or "celda_CG".}

\item{c1}{Integer vector. Cell populations to include in group 1 for the differential expression analysis.}

\item{c2}{Integer vector. Cell populations to include in group 2 for the differential expression analysis. If NULL, everything in c1 is compared to all other clusters. Default NULL.}

\item{only.pos}{Logical. Whether to only return markers with positive log2fc. Default FALSE.}

\item{log2fc.threshold}{Numeric. A number greater than 0 that specifies the absolute log2 fold change threshold. Only features with absolute value above this threshold will be returned.}

\item{fdr.threshold}{Numeric. A number between 0 and 1 that specifies the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Only features below this threshold will be returned.}
}
\value{
Data frame containing a ranked list (based on the absolute value of log2fc) of putative markers,
   and associated statistics (p-value, log2fc and FDR).
