\title{Check whether a count matrix was the one used in a given celda run}
\usage{
compareCountMatrix(count.matrix, celda.obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{count.matrix}{A numeric matrix of counts}

\item{celda.obj}{A single celda model as generated by celda(), of class "celda_C", "celda_G", "celda_CG"}
}
\value{
TRUE if provided count matrix matches the one used in the celda run, FALSE otherwise
}
\description{
Ensures that the provided celda object was generated from a counts matrix
with similar dimensions to the one provided.
}
\details{
Then, compare the MD5 checksum of a provided count.matrix to the count matrix
checksum on a celda_list object, to see if they're the same.
