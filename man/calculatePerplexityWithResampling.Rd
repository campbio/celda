\title{Calculate and visualize perplexity of all models in a celda_list, with count resampling}
\usage{
calculatePerplexityWithResampling(counts, celda.list, resample = 5,
  seed = 12345)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Integer matrix. Rows represent features and columns represent cells. This matrix should be the same as the one used to generate `celda.mod`.}

\item{celda.list}{Object of class 'celda_list'.}

\item{resample}{Integer. The number of times to resample the counts matrix for evaluating perplexity. Default 5.}

\item{seed}{Parameter to set.seed() for random number generation. Default 12345.}
}
\value{
celda_list. Returns the provided `celda.list` with a `perplexity` property, detailing the perplexity of all K/L combinations that appeared in the celda_list's models.
}
\description{
Calculates the erplexity of each model's cluster assignments given the provided count matrix,
as well as resamplings of that count matrix, providing a distribution of perplexities and a better sense of the 
quality of a given K/L choice.
}
\examples{
celda.sim = simulateCells(model="celda_CG")
celda.mods = celdaGridSearch(model="celda_CG",
                             counts=celda.sim$counts, 
                             K.to.test=2:4, 
                             L.to.test=celda.sim$L, 
                             max.iter=2, nchains=2)
perp.with.resampling = calculatePerplexityWithResampling(celda.sim$counts, celda.mods)
