\title{Simulate count data from the celda generative models.}
\usage{
simulateCells(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The celda generative model to use (one of celda_C, celda_G, celda_CG)}
\item{S}{Total number of samples (celda_C, celda_CG)}
\item{...}{Parameters to pass to underlying model.}
}
\description{
This function generates a list containing a simulated counts matrix, as well as various parameters
used in the simulation which can be useful for running celda. The user must provide the desired model
(one of celda_C, celda_G, celda_CG) as well as any desired tuning parameters for those model's simulation
functions as detailed below.
