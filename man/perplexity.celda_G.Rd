\title{Calculate the perplexity on new data with a celda_G model}
\usage{
perplexity.celda_G(counts, celda.mod, new.counts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Integer matrix. Rows represent features and columns represent cells. This matrix should be the same as the one used to generate `celda.mod`.}

\item{celda.mod}{Celda object of class "celda_C"}

\item{new.counts}{A new counts matrix used to calculate perplexity. If NULL, perplexity will be calculated for the 'counts' matrix. Default NULL.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The perplexity for the provided count data and model.
}
\description{
Perplexity is a statistical measure of how well a probability model can predict new data. Lower perplexity indicates a better model.
}
\examples{
perplexity = perplexity(celda.G.sim$counts, celda.G.mod)
}
\seealso{
`celda_G()` for clustering features
