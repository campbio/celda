\title{Generate factorized matrices showing each feature's influence on the celda_CG model clustering}
\usage{
\method{factorizeMatrix}{celda_CG}(counts, celda.mod, type = c("counts",
  "proportion", "posterior"))
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A numerix count matrix}

\item{celda.mod}{object returned from celda_CG function}

\item{type}{one of the "counts", "proportion", or "posterior".}
}
\value{
A list of factorized matrices, of the types requested by the user. NOTE: "population" state matrices are always returned in cell population (rows) x transcriptional states (cols).
