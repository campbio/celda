Description: Celda is a suite of Bayesian hierarchical models for
    clustering single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It is able to
    perform "bi-clustering" and simultaneously cluster genes into gene modules
    and cells into cell subpopulations. It also contains DecontX, a novel
    Bayesian method to computationally estimate and remove RNA contamination in
    individual cells without empty droplet information. A variety of scRNA-seq
    data visualization functions is also included.
